We currently have RAID 1, RAID 5, RAID 6, and RAID 10

## RAID 1
Standard on Elite/CC500/CC1000 servers

RAID 1 is mirrored on both disks

## RAID 5
Standard on all of our non-SSD shared servers

RAID 5 distributes parity along with the data. 1 drive can fail without data
loss. More than 1 drive will result in data loss. Once 1 drive fails a rebuild
or replacement of the drive is necessary to preven data loss.

## RAID 6
Standard on both shared and VP nodes using SSDs and CC2000 dedi's

RAID 6 is similar to RAID 5 but has two parity bits instead of 1. 2 drives can
fail without losing the array. 

## RAID 10 (1+0)
Currently found on our non-SSD VP nodes.

RAID 10 is similar to RAID 1 but the data is also striped across the drives.
This allows up to 2 drives to fail before data loss occurs, as long as no
mirrored set loses both drives. Because of the mirror, information is read from
both drives in the mirrored pair and increases performance significantly.
