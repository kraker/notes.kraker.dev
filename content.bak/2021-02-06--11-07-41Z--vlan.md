# VLAN
_Virtual Local Area Network_
Enables you to segment a physical network into multiple discreet networks
without having additional hardware.
* Create a VLAN by taking a single physical broadcast domain made up of one or
	more switches and chop it up into multiple broadcast domains.
* Requires switches with specific programming to create the virtual networks.
* Typically a single port will be assinged to a specific VLAN
* Can use multiple switches connected to multiple VLANs through a process called
	[trunking](2021-02-06--11-14-13Z--trunking.md).
