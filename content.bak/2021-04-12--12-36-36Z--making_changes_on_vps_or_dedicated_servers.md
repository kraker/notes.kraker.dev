# Making Changes on VPS or Dedicated Servers
[Source](https://wiki.inmotionhosting.com/index.php?title=Making_Changes_on_VPS_or_Dedicated_Servers)

Changes on VPS/Dedi's are not closely monitored. But guidelines should still be
followed.

## Changes on VPS/Dedi
Without customer notification, we may occasionally do the following:
* Rotate cron jobs
* Edit/replace cPanel scripts
* Update cPanel

## When Changes are Made

* The staff member must have been trainiend and is capable of making change
	correctly.
* Integrity is used in making changes. Don't cause issues/damage through
	carelessness or lack of knowledge.
* Customer is made aware of changes that may affect sites, software in
	production, etc.
	
_Always [note the account](http://wiki.inmotionhosting.com/index.php?title=Noting_and_Documenting_Accounts) whenever changes are made._
