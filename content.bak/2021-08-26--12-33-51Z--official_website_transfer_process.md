# Overview 

This is the official process that an agent would take when assisting a customer
with submitting a **website transfer request**. This includes migrations from 3rd
party hosting providers as well as internal migrations. Moving forward all
migration requests whether internal or external will be submitted through AMP by
the customer or with the assistance of an agent using AMPersonate. All requests
are reviewed by either a WTR or Managed Hosting agent and either approved or
denied. Approved requests that don't qualify for a free migration will be quoted
a service fee to perform the migration. 


# Website Transfer Request Process

This is the process either a customer or agent would take when submitting a
**website transfer request (WTR)**. Unlike in the past, both external and internal
migrations are submitted through AMP or via AMPersonate.  This automatically
generates a website transfer request queue item with a linked Zendesk ticket. 

## WTR Process in Detail

1. Login to AMP through the [AMP
login](https://secure1.inmotionhosting.com/index/login) or via AMPersonate. 
2. Click the **Website Transfer Request** button.
3. Click the **Transfer a Website** button. 
4. Choose whether or not you're migrating from an _InMotion Hosting Account_ or an
	 _External Host_ by choosing the appropriate radio button.

### Migrating from an InMotion Hosting account

If this is an _internal migration_ these next steps are how the migration
request is completed.

1. Choose whether or not the hosting account is managed with cPanel by choosing
	 the appropriate radio button.
2. Choose whether or not 2FA is enabled.
3. **Optional:** provide details regarding where data is located. 
	 - If there are any special considerations to be taken into account regarding
		 where someone's data might be located, this can be given here. In a cPanel
		 hosting configuration, where data is located is usually pretty standard. If
		 they're requesting a migration from a non-cPanel environment, Cloud VPS or
		 Bare Metal Dedicated for example, providing details about where to find the
		 data they're submitting the request for is probably helpful.
	 - Further details may be requested by the WTR agent in a follow-up if
		 necessary.
4. **Website Information:** provide the site or sites the request is for.
5. Provide the _preferred contact_ email in the field, or choose the primary
	 email contact for the account. 
6. The customer may choose whether or not to request a priority transfer for
	 additional fee of $29.99.
7. If the request is complete and ready to be submitted click **Submit**
	 otherwise click **Save for Later** or **Cancel** depending on preference.

### Migrating from an external host

The following steps are how a request to migrate from an _external host_ are
completd. 

1. Choose the _External Host_ from the dropdown.  If _other_ be sure to input
	 the external hosting provider in the field provided.
2. Choose whether or not the hosting account is managed with cPanel by choosing
	 the appropriate radio button.
3. Fill out the form with _host login url_, _username_, and _password_.  
4. Follow steps 2 - 7 in section above to complete the request. 

### When in doubt escalate

If there are any questions or concerns when assisting a customer with a website
transfer request please escalate through the appropriate channels. 

# FAQ

### How does support determine the cost of a transfer request?

The website transfer team reviews all website transfer requests and will provide
a quote when appropriate. Internal migrations are quoted using the chart
provided in the internal migration wiki unless qualified for an exception. All
new Managed VPS and Managed Dedicated plans come with Launch Assist time which
can be used to migrate customers from external hosts for free. New shared and
reseller hosting accounts qualify for a _3 item transfer credit_. Beyond the 3
item credit, WTR's are priced according to the pricing wiki.

WTR and Managed Hosting have final say in a quote for migration services. If a
customer asks about costs agents are encouraged have the request submitted and
advise the customer that agent from the migrations team will follow-up with a
quote. If information regarding pricing of our services is provided, agents
should give the customer a disclaimer that any costs are subject to review by
the migrations team and an official quote will be provided only after a request
is submitted, all necessary details are received from the customer and the
request has been fully reviewed by a migrations team member. 

### How do I access the migration services support queue?

In the Power Panel there is a drop-down menu in the upper left-hand corner.  
_PP >> Queues >> Migration Services_ 

### Why do customers with Launch Assist get a free transfer?

Launch Assist is valued at $99.00 and is baked into the intial cost of
onboarding a customer with a qualifying plan. Launch Assist is designed to
facilitate selling new hosting to prospective customers. Offering free migration
and support for server configuration to assist customers with meeting their
hosting needs helps us acquire new customers and ultimately improves our bottom
line. 

### What is a Website Transfer?

A **website transfer** is anything that results in a data migration. This
includes individual site migrations, email migrations, and full cPanel migrations. 
Migrations can be both external and internal. Unlike in the past, the same
request form is used to submit both types of migrations, internal and external. 

### What is the turnaround time?

Expected time to completion is 1 -4 business days starting from the time we have
access to the customer data (i.e. login credentials, 2FA, etc.).
