## Phishing/Fraud Accounts

Process for cancelling accounts identified as fraud:
1. Suspend hosting accounts
2. Lock the AMP account to prevent further purchases
	 + **Account Details > Edit Account > Disable Login > Yes > Submit**
3. Send email to customercare@inmotionhosting.com indicating account terminated
	 due to phishing/fraud.
4. Send customer an "URGENT: Account Pending Termination - Terms of Service
	 Violation" from Power Panel.

## Customer Cancellations

Although rare, sometimes Systems handles customer-requested cancellation. 
1. On the Account & Billing Details page, mouse over Make Changes and select Cancellation.
2. Set the "Reason for Suspension" to Other. Set "Refund Given" to Partial. Note the reason why they are canceling and "Process."
