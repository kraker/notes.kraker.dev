## Task Handoffs

Many systems tasks are lengthy. When handing something off, include the
following info:
* Username
* Current Server
* If the cx was contacted
* Ticket #
* Description of task
	+ Indicate if WTR, account move, hardware failur evac, etc
	+ If it's an account move:
		- Indicate from/too servers
		- Include screen sessions if applicable 
	+ Who else is involved?
	+ What you've done so far.
	+ Any special reqs or notes
* Desc. of follw-up if needed
* When adding tasks in Clarity, make sure above is included in Clarity task
	+ Tickets in Clarity should contain response generated from Clarity until
		ticket is completed
	+ Any action taken on the account should be noted in the account
	+ WCDC staff don't receive Clarity alerts, if something needs to be scheduled
		be sure to create a DC ticket for the time you'd like the taks to be
		performed

## Nagios Handoffs
* A trained Systems person should be logged into Nagios at all times, it should
	never be left unattended
* Before handoff be sure to brief them on any unhandled or ongoing problems
* If an issue is in Nagios but T3 says it doesn't need to be resolved
	immediately, leave a comment in Nagios with corresponding trac/DC ticket, or
	info about why doesn't need to be handled immediately
