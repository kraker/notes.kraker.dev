# SSH
_Secure Shell_
Allows a terminal or client to connect to a host terminal with data encrypted as
it traverses the network.
* Protocol: TCP
* Port: 22
* Basically has replaced [telnet](2020-11-11--15-45-14Z--telnet.md)
* SSH servers use [PKI](2021-02-04--07-42-49Z--pki.md) in the form of an RSA
	key.
* Process:
	1. Server sends public key to client
	2. After the client receives the key, it creates a session ID and encrypts it
		 with the public key.
	3. The server decrypts the session ID and uses it in all data transfers going
		 forward. 
		 - Only the server and client know the session ID
	4. SSH server requests username and password to authenticate the client.
		 - In addition to usernames and passwords, SSH servers can also use public
			 keys to identify clients. A pair of RSA or DSA (Digital Signature
			 Algorithm) keys are created and the public key is copied to the server.
