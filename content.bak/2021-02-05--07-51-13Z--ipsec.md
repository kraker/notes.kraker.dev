# IPsec
_Internet Protocol Security_
An authentication and encryption protocol suite that works at the
Internet/Netwrok layer. 
* **Transport mode**
	Only the actual payload of the IP packet is encrypted: the destination and
	source IP addresses and other IP header information are still readable.
* **Tunnel mode**
	The entire IP packet is encrypted and then placed into an IPsec endpoint where
	it is encapsulated inside another IP packet. 
* Won't be widely utilized until IPv6 is in more widespread use.
* Currently only really used for creating secure tunnels between devices.
