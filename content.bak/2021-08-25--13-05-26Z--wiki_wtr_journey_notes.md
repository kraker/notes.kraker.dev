Update Wiki on new WTR Journey.
or Archive current Wiki and create new one.

Best work-flow would be to just rewrite the existing wiki. Wiki archives old
versions of the page already.

* WTR or MH determines cost of migration.

* Journey includes IM requests and WTR's from 3rd party hosting.

MH or WTR follows up with cost of migration. 

Customer's should always be directed to filling out AMP form for both IM's and
WTR's. Ideally customer's would never be transferred to MH for these. 

Planning to launch new WTR journey on 9/7/2021. 

Creates both a Support Queue Item as well as a ZD ticket when customer's submit
the form.
