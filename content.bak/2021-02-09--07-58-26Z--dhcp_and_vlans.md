# [DHCP](2020-10-21--13-18-28Z--dhcp.md) and [VLANs](2021-02-06--11-07-41Z--vlan.md)
When a _relay agent (AKA DHCP relay)_ is enabled and configured within a router,
the router will pass DHCP messages across the router interfaces.
* Allows a single DHCP server to serve addresses to multiple networks or
	subnets (including VLANs).
