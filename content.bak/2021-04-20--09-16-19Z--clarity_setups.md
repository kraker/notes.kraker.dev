# Clarity Setups
_Credit: Jeff Sh. for original list of tasks_
_Updated by Alex Kr with oneliners. And some edits._

1. Search ZD for the domain to see if there are duplicate Launch Assist setup
	 tickets (sometimes happens).
2. Search Power Panel for the account and load the notes.
3. Go to Bill Items -> Update User Profile. Click Edit -> Edit -> Save on the
	 primary contact.
4. If DNS is showing not setup, head to billing items to fix.
	+ If `DNS Key failed to activate on cPanel server. Invalid JSON string
		returned from ded5565 .inmotionhosting.com`
```bash
( 
yum -y remove imh-python-flask imh-python-werkzeug imh-cpanel-dnsadmin imh-dnskeyapi
yum list installed imh-python-flask imh-python-werkzeug imh-cpanel-dnsadmin imh-dnskeyapi 
read -p "Press Enter to continue" </dev/tty
yum -y install imh-python-flask imh-python-werkzeug imh-cpanel-dnsadmin imh-dnskeyapi
)
```
6. Check bill items
7. Go to Notes and send the Welcome email.
8. Login to server and check hardware was provisioned correctly
	 + Hardware/setup check: 
```bash
(
upcp --force
dedcheck
free -h 
df -h 
lsblk 
cat /etc/trueuserowners
/scripts/dnscluster syncall --full
)
```
	 + If BUM, check that registered, no errors:
```bash
(
/opt/backups/bin/setup.py register 
tail /var/log/backup-runner.log
systemctl status backup-runner
)
```

8. Copy the URL, email and phone for Clarity setup.
9. Search Clarity for the server if it's a dedi, otherwise just the domain and
	 setup Clarity.
10. Go to ZD and associate the ticket with the ZD contact. I do this to make sure
	 that the two are linked and future tickets/chats will work.
11. Solve the ticket.
12. Add notes to Clarity to record time.
```
Clarity setup // Server update // No issues // DNSkey Activated // Checked PP bill items // Sent welcome
```
14. Go to Power Panel and verify that my note copied over, this verifies that I
		entered the correct URL and username in Clarity.
